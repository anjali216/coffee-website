         <p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of
            intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of
            coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a
            possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were
            complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size

          <h1>About Coffee</h1>
          <p>
            Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. 
           It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks. The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. 
           Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways.The discovery of coffee dates back to the 9th century, attributed to an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi.
           According to legend, Kaldi observed his goats dancing energetically after consuming red berries from a
           particular tree. The legend of coffee's discovery dates back to the 9th century in Ethiopia, where a goat herder named
           Kaldi observed his goats becoming unusually energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. Intrigued,
           Kaldi  tried the berries himself and experienced a similar burst of energy. This discovery eventually reached
           the Arabian Peninsula, where coffee cultivation and trade began. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown
           in Yemen and consumed in Persia, Egypt, and Turkey.Coffeehouses, known as "qahveh khaneh," became popular in 
           the Middle East, serving as centers for social
           interaction, intellectual exchange, and business transactions. These establishments spread to Europe in
           the 17th century, starting in Venice and quickly proliferating in major cities like Paris, Vienna, and
           London.European colonists later introduced coffee to the Americas, where it thrived in the tropical climates of
           the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.
